# `sprite-gen gen` — provider-backed image generation (engine SSoT)

Generation is a first-class engine module (`sprite_gen/gen/`), not an external
skill. One call = a prompt (+ optional reference images) → one **verified** PNG on
disk, with an optional deterministic transparent-chroma post-process. The general
`image-gen` skill is a thin shuttle over this command.

Providers (Gemini/OpenRouter/fal/BytePlus are intentionally **not** included):

| Provider | Backend | Auth | Output truth |
|---|---|---|---|
| `codex` | codex `image_gen` | ChatGPT OAuth | inline base64 in the session rollout jsonl, decoded deterministically |
| `grok` | grok Imagine `image_gen` / `image_edit` | xAI OAuth | file grok is told to write, verified by PNG magic |

## Default provider selection

`--provider` is **optional**. When omitted, the backend is resolved by a fixed
precedence (maintainer 확정 2026-07-17):

1. **`SPRITE_GEN_DEFAULT_PROVIDER`** env var (`codex` or `grok`) — the user override.
   An unknown value fails loud.
2. **`codex`** — the hard default (GPT `image_gen`).

If the resolved default is `codex` but codex is unavailable here (CLI not on PATH,
or `codex login status` reports not-logged-in), the resolution **falls back to
`grok` — observably, never silently**: a stderr notice is printed and the report
JSON records `provider_fallback` (`from`/`to`/`reason`/`default_source`). The
grok default (`SPRITE_GEN_DEFAULT_PROVIDER=grok`) has no reverse fallback — a down
grok fails loud at generation time.

An **explicit `--provider`** is always honored verbatim — it is never overridden by
the availability fallback. An explicitly named provider that is down fails loud
(the provider adapter raises), preserving the operator's stated intent.

Every generation reports which backend actually ran: `provider` (the real
backend), `provider_resolved_from` (`explicit` / `SPRITE_GEN_DEFAULT_PROVIDER` /
`hard-default` / `fallback-from-codex`), and `provider_fallback` when a fallback
happened.

## Provider and visible-worker topology

Provider selection and user-facing worker/agent creation are orthogonal:

| Layer | Canonical path | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Generation request | `generate_sprite_image.py --provider grok` | Select the engine provider for one image request. |
| Provider adapter | `GrokProvider` | Build the prompt, choose Imagine `image_gen` or `image_edit`, and verify the requested PNG. |
| Headless provider process | `grok -p --sandbox workspace --always-approve` | Execute the xAI-authenticated Imagine tool call. |
| Image model tool | Imagine `image_gen` / `image_edit` | Generate a new image, or edit from references. |
| Visible worker/agent | (caller's orchestrator) | Creating a user-facing worker surface that may invoke the generation request is the orchestrator's own concern; it does not select or replace the provider. |

Therefore the direct Grok chain is `generate_sprite_image.py --provider grok`
→ `GrokProvider` → `grok -p --always-approve` → Imagine
`image_gen`/`image_edit`. `GrokProvider` owns the headless agent process lifecycle;
the chain does not require or route through a separate user-facing skill/task, and
it is not a second visible-worker topology.

## CLI

```bash
sprite-gen gen \
  [--provider codex|grok] # optional; default = SPRITE_GEN_DEFAULT_PROVIDER env → codex (observable grok fallback if codex is down)
  --prompt "…"            # or --prompt-file PROMPT.txt
  --out DEST.png \
  [--ref REF.png ...]     # repeatable; grok routes refs through image_edit
  [--transparent [--chroma-key magenta|green]] \
  [--white-check CHECK.png] \
  [--aspect-ratio 1:1]    # grok only (1:1, 16:9, 9:16, 4:3, 3:4, auto)
  [--model ID] \
  [--report REPORT.json] \
  [--keep-session]        # codex: keep the rollout jsonl instead of deleting it
```

Backward-compatible wrapper: `$SPRITE_GEN_ROOT/.venv/bin/python $SPRITE_GEN_ROOT/scripts/generate_sprite_image.py …` (same args).

- **Non-transparent**: the raw PNG (chroma background included) is copied to `--out`.
- **`--transparent`**: the raw is keyed to clean RGBA via the ported transparent
  contract (`sprite_gen/gen/chroma.py`). Generate on a solid `#FF00FF` (or `#00FF00`)
  background — pick the key by subject colour (magenta subjects → green key). Any
  transparent pixel that still carries non-zero RGB **fails loudly** (No Silent Fallback).
- The pre-chroma raw is preserved next to the destination as `<out>.raw.png` for audit.
- `--report` writes a `sprite-gen-image-report` JSON: provider, prompt, out/raw paths,
  `raw_bytes`, `elapsed_seconds`, `session_id` (codex), the chroma stats, and the
  provider-resolution fields (`provider_resolved_from`, and `provider_fallback` when a
  codex→grok default fallback occurred).

## How each provider works

- **codex** — spawns a fresh `codex exec --json` in an empty sandbox
  (`--sandbox workspace-write`, `--add-dir <Codex state root>/generated_images`,
  `--skip-git-repo-check`, no `--ephemeral`). A fresh session breaks OpenAI's prompt
  cache so repeat prompts don't drag in a prior image. The session id comes from the
  `thread.started` event (older codex: a `session id:` text line — both supported); the
  inline base64 is decoded from the rollout jsonl (`image_generation_call` /
  `image_generation_end` records — both supported). The model-reported path is never
  trusted. The rollout jsonl (which holds the ~1–1.5 MB inline image) is deleted after
  extraction unless `--keep-session`.
  The adapter and child process share one Codex state root: when `CODEX_HOME` is set they use only that directory; when it is unset they use Codex's `~/.codex` default.
  Rollouts are selected by an exact session-id filename suffix.
  Missing, duplicate, or pre-existing stale matches fail rather than falling back to another root or choosing by modification time.
  The transport prompt names the skill with codex's official `$imagegen` mention, which is how a codex skill is invoked explicitly. The adapter owns that trigger alone; the caller's sprite-request prompt is passed through verbatim.

### When codex produces no image at all

A run that reaches a rollout but finds zero `image_generation_call` /
`image_generation_end` records means the built-in `image_gen` tool was never
offered to the session, not that the model declined to use it. Built-in image
generation is a **capability of the account behind the active Codex state root**.

A session that is not offered the tool cannot be talked into it. The `$imagegen`
mention names the skill, it does not create the tool; the model choice does not
change it; and no `config.toml` feature toggle grants it. The remedy is to point
`CODEX_HOME` at a Codex state root whose account provides image generation
(`codex login status`), or to use `--provider grok`. The adapter fails loudly with
exactly that, rather than falling back on its own.
- **grok** — runs `grok -p … --sandbox workspace --always-approve` (media/shell must be
  auto-approved; plain acceptEdits blocks tool execution and returns an empty answer).
  grok is instructed to write the final PNG to an exact absolute path; we then verify
  that file's PNG magic. No `--effort` is passed (the grok-build image model 400s on
  `reasoningEffort`). With `--ref`, grok uses `image_edit` on the reference instead of
  `image_gen`.

## Sprite-row usage

In the component-row pipeline (SKILL.md §2) generate each state row with
`--provider codex` (or `grok`) using `prompts/<state>.txt`, writing `raw/<state>.png`.
Keep the request chroma key on the background; frame extraction removes it downstream.
The correction loop (`sprite-gen correction-loop --provider-command …`) can drive this
`gen` command as its regeneration step so inspect → score → hint → regenerate closes
against a real provider.

## Speed

On a 4-frame idle mushroom row, grok generated
in ~18.4 s vs codex ~39.0 s (~2.1× faster). codex adhered better to negative constraints
("no grid lines"); grok added faint cell dividers. Pick per need: grok for speed, codex
for tighter prompt adherence.
