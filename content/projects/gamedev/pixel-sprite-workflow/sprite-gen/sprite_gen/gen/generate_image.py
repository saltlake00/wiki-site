"""Deprecated shim — image generation now lives in `sprite_gen.gen`.

This module previously stood in as a desktop-only placeholder during the package
split. Provider-backed generation (codex `image_gen`, grok Imagine) is now a
first-class engine module: `sprite_gen.gen` / CLI `sprite-gen gen`. Keeping two
generation surfaces would violate SSoT, so this shim redirects and fails loudly
if called directly.
